# U-Net based image segmentation for object detection:

Using U-Net based model architecture to identify obstacles and relevant objects when driving.

## Image Segmentation:

Image segmentation partitions an input image into groups of pixels, which can then be used to perform object detection or other tasks, such as object detection.

## About the project:

I am using a model architecture based on U-Net to perform semantic segmentation on dash-cam footage. The model classifies objects as belonging to one of 32 different classes, including people, trees and vehicle, among others.

## About U-Net:
U-Net was proposed in 2015 in the paper [U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation](arXiv:1505.04597). It is a convolutional neural network(CNN) that was developed for the task of biomedical image segmentation.
